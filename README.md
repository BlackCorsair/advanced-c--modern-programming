# Advanced C++ modern programming
## Purpose
This repo contains all the code and notes for the UC3M *Advanced C++ Modern Programming* course.

## Notes
### What is C++?
* If your application is slow, quit your dynamic polimorphism.
* Metaprogramming does not solve the 90% of the use cases.
* You can do Functional Programming.
* Memory leaks -> C++11 use smart pointers so you'll rarely see memory leaks. Daniel usually does a `grep "new"` (to delete them) so there are no memory leaks.
* Buffer overflows -> use a good static analyzer.

# Advanced C++ modern programming
## Purpose
This repo contains all the code and notes for the UC3M *Advanced C++ Modern Programming* course.

## Notes
### What is C++?
* If your application is slow, quit your dynamic polimorphism.
* Metaprogramming does not solve the 90% of the use cases.
* You can do Functional Programming.
* Memory leaks -> C++11 use smart pointers so you'll rarely see memory leaks. Daniel usually does a `grep "new"` (to delete them) so there are no memory leaks.
* Buffer overflows -> use a good static analyzer.
* Macros should be deleted from existence.
* Pragmas, not even once. This is 99% non useful black magic.
* Variadic Macros... vade retro Satan.


## How does it looks like?
* Uniform initiation
`std::vector<int> v {1,2,3,4,5};`
* Range based loop
```
for(auto& x: v) {
    std::cout << x;
}
```

## Uniform Initialization in C++
In C++98 the initilization wasn't uniform, so in C++11 they changed it so it was uniform, easier to read, understand and write.

In one sentence: **all is initialized with `{}`**.

This is the only way to go *generic*.
